## ðŸ“˜ Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

**Description:**  
This script takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd using an `if-else` statement.

**How it works:**
- Takes user input using `input()`
- Converts it to an integer using `int()`
- Uses the modulo operator `%` to check for evenness
- Displays the result using a formatted message

**Sample Output:**
```
Enter a number: 7
7 is an odd number.
```

## ðŸ“˜ Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

**Description:**  
This script calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a `for` loop.

**How it works:**
- Initializes a variable `total_sum = 0`
- Iterates from 1 to 50 using `range()`
- Adds each number to `total_sum` inside the loop
- Prints the final result using an `f-string`

**Sample Output:**
```
The sum of numbers from 1 to 50 is: 1275
```
